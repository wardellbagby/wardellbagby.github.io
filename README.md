## You open-sourced your personal website?

...yes? I didn't think that was that weird! Besides, ya have to take advantage of that free GitHub hosting. ;)

## So like...what even IS your website?

Mostly my ramblings on my projects, a link to wherever I'm blogging these days, and links to some of my internet presences.

## Couldn't help but notice this is a Kotlin repo...

Good eye. This whole thing is written in Kotlin/JS. It's using Jetpack Compose for Web as a framework, which is Jetbrain's attempt to making Jetpack Compose run in a browser.

## Wow! Compose but on the Web?! It's gotta be super cool, right?

Not really. It's fun but React and Typescript are much better if you're running in a browser than Jetpack Compose for Web and Kotlin/JS.

## I thought you LOVED Kotlin?! Surprised to hear this from you!

Fair point, but not every language works everywhere! Kotlin/JS has too strict of a type system to accurately work with JS and Jetpack Compose for Web doesn't include any UI components, so you end up writing CSS anyway. If I've got to deal with `dynamic` and CSS anyway, I might as well use Typescript and React and at least get the benefit of the rest of the web community using the same tooling.

I'd be much more into Kotlin/JS if I could use it alongside normal Typescript. C'mon Jetbrains, bring back the kotlin-loader for Webpack!

## Did you do anything cool with this website?

Hmm...well, I did write my own router, which I think is pretty swell. I also took care to make the whole thing easily translatable even though I only know English... Maybe one day, my Vietnamese will be decent and I can self-translate my own website!
